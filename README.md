### 1. 📄 **Tasks**

A task tracker sheet that lists various data analysis functions applied to the dataset.  
Each task includes the goal, the formula used, and its implementation status.

Here are some examples of the tasks completed:
| Task | Instruction | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Total Orders | Used `SUM` to calculate total orders across dataset | ✔️ |
| Average Sales per Month | Used `AVERAGEIF` to get monthly averages | ✔️ |
| Count Sales Over $1000 | Used `COUNTIF` to count number of sales > $1000 | ✔️ |
| Orders by Employee | Used `SUMIF` to summarize total orders by each employee | ✔️ |
| Max Orders in IT | Used `MAXIFS` (or similar) to find max orders in IT department | ✔️ |

### 2. 📊 **Sales Data**

This is the main data sheet that includes a wide range of metrics for employee performance and department statistics.

#### 📌 Key Work Done:
- **Data Cleaning & Structure**:
  - Standardized column headers and organized data for readability.

- **Descriptive Metrics**:
  - Added columns for:
    - `Orders by Employee` using `SUMIF`
    - `Average Sales per Month` using `AVERAGEIF`
    - `Count Sales Over $1000` using `COUNTIF`
    - `Average Monthly Sales in Egypt` using `AVERAGEIFS`
    - `Number of Employees per Department` using `COUNTIF`
    - `Average Rating per Department` using `AVERAGEIFS`

- **Lookup & Conditional Logic**:
  - Used `VLOOKUP` to retrieve department of a specific employee.
  - Used `IF` logic to calculate bonus based on `Customer Rating` (e.g., if rating > 4.5, give $200, else $100).

- **Categorization**:
  - Added a `Performance Tag` column (e.g., High, Medium, Low) to classify employee output.
